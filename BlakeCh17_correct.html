      <h3>Chapter XVII: Henry at Large</h3>
       
       <table style="border-top: none; border-top-style: none;">
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>On leaving the plantation carrying them hanging upon his arm, thrown across his shoulders, and in his hands Henry had a bridle, halter, blanket, girt, and horsewhip, the emblems of a faithful servant in discharge of his master&apos;s business.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>By shrewdness and discretion such was his management as he passed along, that he could tell the name of each place and proprietor, long before he reached them. Being a scholar, he carefully kept a record of the plantations he had passed, that when accosted by a white, as an overseer or patrol, he invariably pretended to belong to a back estate, in search of his master&apos;s race horse. If crossing a field, he was taking a near cut; but if met in a wood, the animal was in the forest, as being a great leaper no fence could debar him, though the forest was fenced and posted. The blanket a substitute for a saddle, was in reality carried for a bed.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>With speed unfaltering and spirits unflinching, his first great strive was to reach the Red River, to escape from his own state as quickly as possible Proceeding on in the direction of the Red River country, he met with no obstruction, except in one instance, when he left his assailant quietly upon the earth. A few days after an inquest was held upon the body of a deceased overseer&#8212;verdict of the Jury, &apos;By hands unknown.&apos;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>On approaching the river, after crossing a number of streams, as the Yazoo, Ouchita, and such, he was brought to sad reflections. A dread came over him, difficulties lie before him, dangers stood staring him in the face at every step he took. Here for the first time since his maturity of manhood responsibilities rose up in a shape of which he had no conception. A mighty undertaking, such as had never before been ventured upon, and the duty devolving upon him, was too much for a slave with no other aid than the aspirations of his soul panting for liberty. Reflecting upon the peaceful hours he once enjoyed as a professing Christian, and the distance which slavery had driven him from its peaceful portals, here in the wilderness, determining to renew his faith and dependence upon Divine aid, when falling upon his knees, he opened his heart to God, as a tenement of the Holy Spirit.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col">5</td><td>&apos; Arm of the Lord awake! renew my faith, confirm my hope, perfect me in love. Give strength, give courage, guide and protect my pathway, and direct me in my course!&apos; Springing to his feet as if a weight had fallen from him, he stood up a new man.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>The river is narrow, the water red as if colored by iron rust, the channel winding. Beyond this river lies his hopes, the broad plains of Louisiana with a hundred thousand bondsmen, seeming anxiously to await him.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Standing upon a high bank of the stream, contemplating his mission, a feeling of humbleness, and a sensibility of unworthiness impressed him, and that religious sentiment which once gave comfort to his soul now inspiring anew his breast, Henry raised in solemn tones amidst the lonely wilderness:</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>&apos; Could I but climb where Moses stood, </td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>And view the landscape o&apos;er;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col">10</td><td>Not Jordan&apos;s streams, nor death&apos;s cold flood, </td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Could drive me from the shore !&apos;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>To the right of where he stood was a cove, formed by the washing of the stream at high water, which ran quite into the thicket, into which the sun shone through a space among the high trees.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>While thus standing and contemplating his position, the water being too deep to wade, and on account of numerious sharks and alligators, too dangerous to swim, his attention was attracted by the sound of a steamer coming up the channel. Running into the cove to shield himself, a singular noise disturbed him, when to his terror he found himself amidst a squad of huge alligators, which sought the advantages of the sunshine.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>His first impulse was to surrender himself to his fate and be devoured, as in the rear and either side, the bank was perpendicular, escape being impossible except by the way he entered, to do which would have exposed him to the view of the boat, which could not have been avoided. Meantime the frightful animals were crawling over and among each other, at a fearful rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col">15</td><td>Seizing the fragment of a limb which lay in the cove, beating upon the ground and yelling like a madman, giving them all possible space, the beasts were frightened at such a rate, that they reached the water in less time than Henry reached the bank. Receding into the forest, he thus escaped the observation of the passing steamer, his escape serving to strengthen his fate in a renewed determination of spiritual dependence.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>While gazing upon the stream in solemn reflection for Divine aid to direct him, logs came floating down, which suggested a proximity to the raft with which sections of that stream is filled, when going but a short distance up, he crossed in safety to the Louisiana side. His faith was now fully established, and thenceforth, Henry was full of hope and confident of success.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Reaching Alexandria with no obstruction, his first secret meeting was held in the hut of aunt Dilly. Here he found them all ready for an issue.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>&apos; An dis you chile ?&apos; said the old woman, stooping with age, sitting on a low stool in the chimney corner ; &apos;dis many day, I heahn on yeh !&apos; though Henry had just entered on his mission. From Alexandria he passed rapidly on to Latuer&apos;s making no immediate stops, prefering to organize at the more prominent places.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>This is a mulatto planter, said to have come from the isle of Guadaloupe. Riding down the road upon a pony at a quick gallop, was a mulatto youth a son of the planter, an old black man on foot keeping close to the horse&apos;s heels.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col">20</td><td>&apos;Whose boy are you?&apos; enquried the young mulatto, who had just dismounted, the old servant holding his pony.</td></tr>
