<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>The season is the holidays, it is evening, and the night is beautiful. The moon, which in Louisiana is always an object of impressive interest, even to the slave as well as those of enlightened and scientific intelligence, the influence of whose soft and mellow light seems ever like the enchanting effect of some invisible being, to impart inspiration&#8212;now being shed from the crescent of the first day of the last quarter, appeared more interesting and charming than ever.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Though the cannon at the old fort in the Lower <i>Faubourg</i> had fired the significant warning, admonishing the slaves as well as free blacks to limit their movements, still there were passing to and fro with seeming indifference negroes, both free and slaves, as well as the whites and creole quadroons, fearlessly along the public highways, in seeming defiance of the established usage of negro limitation.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>This was the evening of the day of <i>Maid digras</i>, and from long established and time-honored custom, the celebration which commenced in the morning was now being consummated by games, shows, exhibitions, theatrical performances, festivals, <i>masquerade</i> balls, and numerous entertainments and gatherings in the evening. It was on this account that the negroes had been allowed such unlimited privileges this evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Nor were they remiss to the utmost extent of its advantages.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col">5</td><td>The city which always at this season of the year is lively, and Chartier street gay and fashionable, at this time appeared more lively, gay and fashionable than usual. This fashionable thoroughfare, the pride of the city, was thronged with people, presenting complexions of every shade and color. Now could be seen and realized the expressive description in the popular song of the vocalist Cargill: </td></tr>

<tr><td class="num-col">10</td><td>The extensive shops and fancy stores presented the presence behind their counters as saleswomen in attendance of numerous females, black, white, mulatto and quadroon, politely bowing, courtesying, and rubbing their hands,&#8212;in accents of broken English inviting to purchase all who enter the threshold, or even look in at the door:</td></tr>

<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>The fancy stores and toy shops on this occasion were crowded seemingly to their greatest capacity. Here might be seen the fashionable young white lady of French or American extraction, and there the handsome, and frequently beautiful maiden of African origin, mulatto, quadroon, or sterling black, all fondly interchanging civilities, and receiving some memento or keepsake from the hand of an acquaintance. Many lively jests and impressive flings of delicate civility noted the greetings of the passers-by. Freedom seemed as though for once enshielded by her sacred robes and crowned with cap and wand in hand, to go forth untrammeled through the highways of the town. Along the private streets, sitting under the verandas, in the doors with half closed <i>jalousies</i>, or promenading unconcernedly the public ways, mournfully i humming in solace or chanting in lively glee, could be seen and heard many a creole, male or female, black, white or mixed race, sometimes in reverential praise of&#8212;</td></tr>

In the distance, on the levee or in the harbor among the steamers, the songs of the boatmen were incessant. Every few hours landing, loading and unloading, the glee of these men of sorrow was touchingly appropriate and impressive. Men of sorrow they are in reality ; for if there be a class of men anywhere to be found, whose sentiments of song and words of lament are made to reach the sympathies of others, the black slave-boatmen on the Mississippi river is that class. Placed in positions the most favorable to witness the pleasures enjoyed by others, the tendency is only to augment their own wretchedness.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Fastened by the unyielding links of the iron cable of despotism, reconciling themselves to a life-long misery, they are seemingly contented by soothing their sorrows with songs and sentiments of apparently cheerful, but in reality wailing lamentations. The most attracting lament of the evening was sung to words, a stanza of which is presented in pathos of delicate tenderness, which is but a spray from the stream which gushed out in insuppressible jets from the agitated fountains of their souls, as if in unison with the restless current of the great river upon which they were compelled to toil, their troubled waters could not be quieted. In the capacity of leader, as is their custom, one poor fellow in pitiful tones lead off the song of the evening:</td></tr>

Swiftly as the current of the fleeting Mississippi was time passing by, and many states lay in expanse before him, all of which, by the admonishing impulses of the dearest relations, he was compelled to pass over as a messenger of light and destruction.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Light, of necessity, had to be imparted to the darkened region of the obscure intellects of the slaves, to arouse them from their benighted condition to one of moral responsibility, to make them sensible that liberty was legitimately and essentially theirs, without which there was no distinction between them and the brute.  Following as a necessary consequence would be the destruction of oppression and ignorance.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Alone and friendless, without a home, a fugitive from slavery, a child of misfortune and outcast upon the world, floating on the cold surface of chance, now in the midst of a great city of opulence, surrounded by the most despotic restrictions upon his race, with renewed determination Henry declared that nothing short of an unforeseen Providence should impede his progress in the spread of secret organization among the slaves. So aroused, he immediately started for a house in the <i>Lower Faubourg</i>. </td></tr>

<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>On entering, from the number and arrangement of the seats, there was evidence of an anticipated gathering ; but the evening being that of the <i>Maid di gras</i>, there was nothing very remarkable in this. Out from another room came a sharp, observing, shrewd little dark brown-skin woman, called in that community a <i>griffe</i>. Bowing, sidling and courtesying, she smilingly came forward.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>&apos; Phebe, go tell &apos;em,&apos; said Seth ; when lightly tripping away she entered the door of the other room, which after a few moments&apos; delay was partially opened, and by a singular and peculiar signal, Seth and the stranger were invited in. Here sat in one of the most secret and romantic-looking rooms, a party of fifteen, the representatives of the heads of that many plantations, who that night had gathered for the portentious purpose of a final decision on the hour to strike the first blow.  On entering, Henry stood a little in check.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>&apos;I am not fit, brother, for a spiritual leader  my warfare is not Heavenly, but earthly; I have not to do with angels, but with men; not with righteousness, but wickedness. Call upon some brother who has more of the grace of God than I. If I ever were a Christian, slavery has made me a sinner; if I had been an angel, it would have made me a devil !

<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>The splitting of the table was regarded as omenous, but of doubtful signification, the major part considering it as rather unfavorable. Making no delay, lest a dispondency ensue through fear and superstition, Henry at once entered into seclusion, completing an organization.</td></tr>
