I tole yeh so, but yeh uden bleve me !&apos; and the old man and woman stood for some minutes in breathless silence, although the boat must have been some five miles distant, as the escape of steam can be heard on the western waters a great way off.</td></tr>

In motionless attitude after the departure of her husband this morning, the old woman stood awaiting the steamer, when presently the boat arrived. But then to be certain that it was the expected vessel&#8212;now came the suspense.</td></tr>

I want something on this earth as well as a promise of things in another world. I and my wife have been both robbed of our liberty, and you want me to be satisfied with a hope of heaven. I won&apos;t do any such thing; I have waited long enough on heavenly promises ; I&apos;ll wait no longer. I&#8212;&apos;</td></tr>

A man of good literary attainments&#8212;unknown to Col. Franks, though he was aware he could read and write&#8212;having been educated in the West Indies, and decoyed away when young. His affection for wife and child was not excelled by colonel Franks for his. He was bold, determined and courageous, but always mild, gentle and courteous, though impulsive when an occasion demanded his opposition.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Going immediately to the place, he presented himself before his master. Much conversation ensued concerning the business which had been entrusted to his charge, all of which was satisfactorily transacted, and full explanations concerning the horses, but not a word was uttered concerning the fate of Maggie, the Colonel barely remarking &apos; your mistress is unwell.&apos;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col">30</td><td>After conversing till a late hour, Henry was assigned a bed in the great house, but sleep was far from his eyes. He turned and changed upon his bed with restlessness and anxiety, impatiently awaiting a return of the morning.</td></tr>
