<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>For the remainder of the night secreting themselves in Conti and Burgundi streets, the rebel proprietors of the house in which was laid the plot for the destruction of the city were safe until the morning, their insurrectionary companions having effected a safe retreat to the respective plantations to which they belonged, that evening.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Jason and Phebe Seth were the hired slaves of their own time from a widower master, a wealthy retired attorney at Baton Rouge, whose only concern about them was to call every ninety days at the counter of the Canal Bank of New Orleans, and receive the price of their hire, which was there safely deposited to his credit by the industrious and faithful servants. The house in which the rebels met, had been hired for the occasion, being furnished rooms kept for transient accommodation.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>On the earliest conveyance destined for the City of Mobile, Henry left, who, before he fled, admonished as his parting counsel, to &apos;stand still and see the salvation;&apos; the next day being noted by General Ransom, as an incident in his history, to receive a formal visit of a fortnight&apos;s sojourn, in the person of his slaves Jason and Phebe Seth.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>The inquisition held in the case of the betrayer Tib, developed fearful antecedence of extensive arrangements for the destruction of the city by fire and water, thereby compelling the white inhabitants, to take refuge in the swamps, whilst the blacks marched up the coast, sweeping the plantations as they went.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col">5</td><td>Suspicions were fixed upon many, among whom was an unfortunate English school-teacher,[1] who was arested and imprisoned, when he died, to the last protesting his innocence. Mr. Farland was a good and brave hearted man, disdaining to appeal for redress to his country, lest it might be regarded as the result of cowardice.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="num-col"> </td><td>Taking fresh alarm at this incident, the municipal regulations have been most rigid in a system of restriction and <i>espionage</i> toward negroes and mulattoes, almost destroying their self-respect and manhood, and certainly impairing their usefulness.</td></tr>
