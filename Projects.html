	<h3>Collective Biographies of Women</h3>
	<p>Created by University of Virginia professor Alison Booth, <a href="http://cbw.iath.virginia.edu/cbw_db/index.php">Collective Biographies of Women</a> is a digital prosopography (study of biographical networks) which assembles records of women whose lives were chronicled in 19th-century collective biographies.  The collection links its subjects by the particular biographies in which they were included.  For instance, which other women are featured in biographies alongside Queen Victoria?  Who appeared in the same biographies as Lola Montez?  By asking and answering such questions, the project examines methods of typing women in the 19th century.</p>
	<p>I assisted by editing the person records in the CBW database, which gave me the opportunity to learn about relational databases.  I also conducted TEI markup on the biographical texts, another focus of CBW being analyzing the types of narrative elements included in the biographies themselves.  For this, I learned how to use Oxygen XML Editor and was introduced to the basics of XML.</p>
	
	<h3>Documents Compass: People of the Founding Era</h3>
	<p><a href="documentscompass.org">Documents Compass</a> is a part of the digital initiative of the <a href="virginiahumanities.org">Virginia Foundation for the Humanities</a>.  It maintains the Papers of the Founding Fathers Early Access Project, which provides access to digital editions of the documents written and received by the Founding Fathers.  The project <a href="http://pfe.rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/">People of the Founding Era</a> assembles the persons mentioned in the Founding Fathers' papers in a relational database.  Each person's record includes biographical details such as birth, death, occupation, military service, educational institutions attended, etc.  Also included in the database are occupation records, institution records, and location records.  The panoply of record types enables us to sort persons in a variety of ways.  For instance, a researcher might search for all the female cheesemongers living in Virginia at the time.</p>
	<p>As an intern for Documents Compass, I expanded the PFE collection to include enslaved people, professors, professor family members, hotel keepers, and students who lived and worked at the University of Virginia.  In the process, I also brainstormed new ways of linking these people.  One very significant area of my research was who lived, worked in, or helped to build the different buildings in Thomas Jefferson's Academical Village.  This research is especially significant for reconstructing and visualizing slave communities on the campus of the University of Virginia.  I presented this research with my supervisor, Sue Perdue, and Encyclopedia Virginia editor Brendan Wolfe at the Virginia Universities and Race Histories Conference in November 2013.</p>

	<h2>The Ivanhoe Game WordPress Theme: a Practicum Project by the 2013-14 Praxis Fellows</h2>
	<p>The <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> is a year-long fellowship which trains six humanities graduate students in conceiving, planning, developing, designing, and marketing a digital project.  <a href="www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a> faculty and staff guide the students through the entire process, giving lessons in coding, digital collaboration, project management, and a myriad of other skills necessary to building a DH tool.</p>
	
	<p>The Ivanhoe Game was originally conceived by Johanna Drucker and Jerome McGann in the early 2000s, then developed in the UVa SpecLab by Bethany Nowviskie and others. Our Praxis cohort was assigned the task of rebuilding it. We decided to bring it back as a WordPress Theme so it would be easily accessible to academics.  The Ivanhoe Game is a space in which players make interventions or commentary on a text or cultural object in support of a particular roles, or theoretical stances, which they assume.  For more on the history and theoretical underpinnings of Ivanhoe, visit <a href="http://www.ivanhoegame.org/?page_id=21">the original info site</a>. </p>

	<p>I served as project manager on this team, keeping track of deadlines, checking in with team members' progress, making decisions on the scope of the project, and planning publicity. Along the way, I gained skills in HTML and CSS, learned version control on GitHub, became proficient at using WordPress to publish posts on our team blog, and also got experience working with developers and designers to decide on key features of our tool.  I did not directly work on the code of Ivanhoe, but I do understand how it works and the challenges our developers faced in the process.  I also spent countless hours with our design team discussing the aesthetic of Ivanhoe.  On our informational website, I did not do the CSS myself, but I did organize and enter all the content in HTML.  My project managerial education can be traced in the posts I wrote for our team blog.</p>

	<p>We launched Ivanhoe on April 29. Read about our experiences on our Praxis blog at <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">http://praxis.scholarslab.org/</a>, and learn more about Ivanhoe and download the theme at <a href="http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/">http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/</a></p>

	<h3>Ellen Glasgow's <i>In This Our Life</i>: a Critical Edition</h3>
	<p>I edited three chapters of Glasgow's final published novel for Professor Vander Meulen's course "Introduction to Scholarly Editing and Textual Criticism."  Although my edition is an unpublished term project, my research did culminate in the blog post I contributed to the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections blog, UVA Under Grounds: <a href="http://smallnotes.library.virginia.edu/2013/09/27/ellen-glasgow-mystery-solved/">"Ellen Glasgow, James Branch Cabell, and a Manuscript Mystery Solved!</a>  It also led to a paper which I presented for the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia's 2014 Graduate Student Forum, this past March.</p>
	<p>Completed May 2013.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="Blakeindex.html">Collation of M.R. Delany's <i>Blake, or, The Huts of America</i></a></h3>
	<p>For Jerome McGann's Fall 2013 seminar "American Historiography," I am collating the two versions of M.R. Delany's novel <i>Blake, or The Huts of America</i>, one of the earliest African American novels, published in the United States in 1859, then again in 1861, in serial form by the <i>Anglo-African Magazine</i>.  No one has collated (comparing word-for-word) the two versions, but such a project is vital in determining whether Delany revised his work.  This knowledge could substantially inform our understanding of the mysterious conclusion of the novel.  I am using <a href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org/">Juxta</a> collation software, by NINES, for the project.</p>
	<p>Completed December 2013.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://stephanie-kingsley.github.io/Mercedes/index.html">James Fenimore Cooper's <i>Mercedes of Castile</i>: a Digital Edition</a></h3>
	<p>For my these, I edited two the Preface and one chapter of Cooper's novel <i>Mercedes of Castile</i>, in which Cooper retells Christopher Columbus's discovery of the Americas.  The novel was published in 1840, by Carey and Lea in Philadephia, and then by Richard Bentley in London in 1841.  Two other English-language editions came out the same year in Paris, published by A. and W. Galignani and Baudry's European Library.  The work was also translated into Spanish, French, and German that year.  I have collated (compared word for word) the English-language editions with the manuscript, held in UVA Special Collections, in order to establish what Cooper's final intentions for his work were, and to restore corruptions in the published text.</p>
	<p>For my Rare Book School Fellowship, I constructed a digital edition of the portion of <i>Mercedes</i> which I edited. I used XML markup, XSLT, and JavaScript to display the textual witnesses and variants. The edition won Honorable Mention for the Betsy and Stuart Houston Prize for Most Outstanding Project and will be featured on the Rare Book School website [link soon to be posted].</p>
	<p>Completed April 2014.</p>
