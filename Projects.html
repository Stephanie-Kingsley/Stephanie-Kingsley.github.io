		<p>This is a collection of prosopographical records that I began building in the summer of 2013 as part of Documents Compass's People of the Founding Era.  This collection features enslaved people, professors, professor family members, hotel keepers, and students who lived and worked at the University of Virginia.  Similar to the Papers of the Founding Fathers and the Founding Era Collection, this collection will aim to build these person records, as well as create digital editions of University archival documents.</p>

	<h4>Ellen Glasgow's <i>In This Our Life</i>: a Critical Edition</h4>
	<p>I edited three chapters of Glasgow's final published novel for Professor Vander Meulen's course "Introduction to Scholarly Editing and Textual Criticism."  Although my edition is an unpublished term project, my research did culminate in the blog post I contributed to the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections blog, UVA Under Grounds: <a href="http://smallnotes.library.virginia.edu/2013/09/27/ellen-glasgow-mystery-solved/">"Ellen Glasgow, James Branch Cabell, and a Manuscript Mystery Solved!</a></p>
	<p>Finished May 2013.</p>
	<a href="Blakeindex.html"><h4>Collation of M.R. Delany's <i>Blake, or, The Huts of America</i></h4></a>
	<p>For Jerome McGann's Fall 2013 seminar "American Historiography," I am collating the two versions of M.R. Delany's novel <i>Blake, or The Huts of America</i>, one of the earliest African American novels, published in the United States in 1859, then again in 1861, in serial form by the <i>Anglo-African Magazine</i>.  No one has collated (comparing word-for-word) the two versions, but such a project is vital in determining whether Delany revised his work.  This knowledge could substantially inform our understanding of the mysterious conclusion of the novel.  I am using <a href="http://www.juxtasoftware.org/">Juxta</a> collation software, by NINES, for the project.</p>
	<p>To be concluded December 5.</p>
	<h4>James Fenimore Cooper's <i>Mercedes of Castile</i>: a Digital Edition</h4>
	<p>I am editing Cooper's novel <i>Mercedes of Castile</i>, in which Cooper retells Christopher Columbus's discovery of the Americas.  The novel was published in 1840, by Carey and Lea in Philadephia, and then by Richard Bentley in London in 1841.  Two other English-language editions came out the same year in Paris, published by A. and W. Galignani and Baudry's European Library.  The work was also translated into Spanish, French, and German that year.  I have collated (compared word for word) the English-language editions with the manuscript, held in UVA Special Collections, in order to establish what Cooper's final intentions for his work were, and to restore corruptions in the published text.  This will result in a critical edition, which I will submit for my Master's thesis on April 14.</p>
	<p>For my Rare Book School Fellowship--and as a natural step from my critical edition--I am also constructing a digital edition of the portion of <i>Mercedes</i> which I have chosen to edit. I will be using XML markup, XSLT, and JSON D3 templates to display the various forms of the text. Stay tuned for updates. I will post a link once the edition is complete.</p>
	<p>To be completed April 11.</p>
	<h4>The Kingsley Family Archives (prospective)</h4>
	<p>This is a site I am creating in my spare time as a way of archiving letters and photographs of the Kingsley and related families.  I hope to eventually have all Kingsley correspondence digitized, then link those documents and photographs to genealogical records.</p>
	<p>Prospective.</p>
