	<p>After surveying all the changes made between 1859 and 1861, I can conclude that Delany did, indeed, revise his text, but he did not do so extensively in terms of restructuring, reworking, adding, or deleting large portions of text.  My impression of Delany's revision of Blake is that in anticipation of its republication in the 1861 Anglo-African Weekly, he read through it and made quick, simple changes, generally enhancing and smoothing out the language, rather than substantially changing its purpose or meaning.  When writing to William Lloyd Garrison in 1859 seeking his assistance in getting the work published as a book, Delany mentioned the need for revision: 
		<blockquote>The three chapters published in the first number of the Magazine, were full of errors, in consequence of the hurried manner in which it was got out, and the whole will be carefully revised and corrected as far as published up to the time, should the work be taken up by a publisher. 1</blockquote>  
	Perhaps by 1861 when Delany had not found a publisher for his work, he decided it needed polishing for reprinting anyway.</p>
	<p>The collations reveal many variants, accidental and substantive, between the 59 and 61 texts.  These include both variants for which Delany most likely was responsible, as well as those that could have been the result of editorial intervention or typesetter error.  I am dividing them into the categories of style, printing errors, and substantive.  "Style" refers to issues such as hyphenation, capitalization, abbreviation and punctuation, which either the author or editor could have reworked.  I do not know how thoroughly Delany typically revised these elements, and for this reason I cannot make a call as to whether he was or was not responsible for style changes.  Printing errors are errors which transpired while the typesetter was setting the type in the galleys from copy.  This category is particularly problematic because, as noted in "Collation Procedures," my 59 text is not taken from the original but a reprint of Vol. I of the <i>Anglo-African Magazine</i>—so their printing errors could have made it into the text, as well.  I hesitate to draw any conclusions about Delany's intentions from these categories of variants, although they are vastly valuable to scholars interested in the inner workings of the press of the <i>Anglo-African Magazine</i>, 19th-century printing style, or typesetting practices.  "Substantive" variants refer to the changes which alter the wording or meaning of the text and are likely to have been the result of Delany's revisions.</p>

	<h3>Style</h3>
	<p>As mentioned before, this category includes any changes which could have been either Delany's or the editor's, in an attempt to adapt his language to house style or other writing conventions.  Hyphenation falls under this head.  Generally, the 59 text hyphenates compound words much more frequently than the 61: for instance,</p> 

	<p>maid-servant] <strong>59</strong>; maid servant <strong>61</strong> (Ch. II)</p>  

	<p>This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it is consistent and pervasive enough through the 26 chapters collated to declare it a pattern.  Another such change is in capitalization of titles, such as "Colonel Franks," "Mammy Judy," and "Daddy Joe."  59 usually does not capitalize such titles, even when followed by the person's proper name, while the 61 usually does so.  Similarly, when Henry addresses Mammy Judy as "Mammy" alone, the word is lowercase in 59 and uppercase in 61.  Both hyphenation and capitalization seem likely to be the result of an editor standardizing, but they could equally be Delany's corrections.  As mentioned before, one would need to ascertain Delany's editorial habits by examining any surviving correspondence between him and his publisher for clues, among other potential sources.</p>

	<p>Another type of style change attributable to either Delany or the publisher/editor, includes punctuation marks—primarily commas and semicolons.  When a character addresses another, for instance, 59 often neglects the comma before the addressee's name, while 61 usually restores it, as in the following: "I will not consent to part with her, cousin Arabella" (Ch. III).  Additionally, commas used more abundantly in 61 to indicate sentence structure, as in,
	<blockquote>
		<p>Upon this principle Colonel Franks acted] <strong>59</strong>; ~principle,~ <strong>61</strong></p>
		<p>Mrs. Franks grasping hold of his arm exclaimed] <strong>59</strong>; ~Franks, grasping hold of his arm, ~ <strong>61</strong> (7)</p>
	</blockquote></p>

<p>The times when 61 departs from this pattern, it appears to do so when their use might result in too many commas.  For instance: "You know, Colonel, that I gave my word to Henry, her husband, your most faithful servant] 59; ~Henry^~ 61 (Ch. III).</p>
<p>Semicolons are more consistently used in 61 to designate a break between two related independent clauses, rather than a comma, as in
	<blockquote>'I know it,' answered he, 'but you know] <strong>59</strong>; ~he; 'but~ <strong>61</strong></blockquote></p>
<p>Another common change is the spelling of 'enquired' in 59 to 'inquired' in 61.  It is consistently done, and it is potentially interesting in perhaps reflecting shifting spelling habits, but one would need to do more research, consulting dictionaries of the time.  The change could simply be the result of an editor's whim.  This is difficult to know.  Enquire] inquire is the only such consistent spelling alteration in the collated chapters</p>
<p>Contraction spellings are problematic and inconsistent.  For instance, "can't" could be spelt any of the following ways: can't, ca'nt, can 't, or cant.  Patterns within chapters occasionally arise, as when Henry's contractions are correctly spelt and apostrophized while he speaks with Colonel Franks in Chapter VII.  When speaking with Mammy Judy and Daddy Joe, however, Henry's contractions lose their apostrophes.  If this is done for a deliberate reason by Delany, it could signify a concern with letting Henry be the grammatical equal of Franks while not looking too out of place with his parents-in-law; this idea is not, however, consistent with the clear distinction Henry receives by his manner of speaking overall.  I have been unable to dedicate enough attention to contraction spellings; I only point it out as one of the idiosyncrasies of the work any scholar interested in its textual history must be prepared to consider.  To delve into this question, I would produce a table of the spellings which occur in each chapter and their frequency of use.  The results could point to a deliberate pattern, but I suspect them to be arbitrary, or at the most, to be the result of the whims of various compositors.</p>
<p>Another element to mention is the use of italics.  While the 59 text employs italics for emphasis, the 61 text does not until around Chapter XVI.  I do not know how to account for this, but I have included the italicized text in my HTML text, as well as represented the places where italics fail to appear in the 61 in the apparatus.</p>

<h3>Accidentals: Printer's Errors</h3>
<p>There are many compositor errors which occur in both 59 and 61.  Below is a sample of the sorts of errors which appear; they affect word order, spelling, and punctuation.  As is clear in the examples, both editions of the novel have plenty of errors, so an eclectic edition would be necessary adopting the correct variants in each.</p>

<blockquote>
<table style="border-top: none; border-top-style: none;">
<tr><td>Ch. III</td><td>Oh, is there no hope for me?] <b>59;</b> ~there is~ <b>61</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ch. IV</td><td>'Po' me! po' me! po' me!] <b>59;</b> 'Po'! po' me! po' me!' <b>61</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ch. V</td><td>out of every ally] <b>59;</b> ~alley <b>61</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ch. VIII</td><td>sir name] <b>59;</b> surname <b>61</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ch. XV</td><td>formely] <b>59;</b> formerly <b>61</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Ch. XV</td><td>bachelor] <b>59;</b> batchelor <b>61</b></td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>In some cases, even larger portions of text get left out as the result of compositor error.  For instance, in Ch. VII, Franks' question to Henry "Where's the other horse?" got omitted in 61, making the flow of dialogue between Franks and Henry not make sense.  This was clearly not how Delany wrote the passage, but most likely the result of error on the part of a dyslexic compositor.</p>

<p>Errors result not only from compositors misreading or mispelling, but mis-setting their type.  Often, 'u's are flipped and become 'n's, and vice versa, changing "Laud" to "Land" or "Andy" to "Audy."  In Ch. XIV, "Minney" became "Winney," probably because the 'M' was turned upside down.  </p>

<p>In many cases, errors result from type having either worn down or fallen out of the form.  There are places at the ends of lines in particular where punctuation types have disappeared.  Consequently, there are many variants resulting from missing end punctuation.  Misspelled words also result from places where type has fallen out.  In refining this project in order to make it more helpful to scholars, I would include a designation, such as an *, on all such variants, as the spacing is not always represented in the digitized text and collation apparatus.</p>

<h3>Substantive: Dialect Spellings</h3>
<p>The most pervasive sort of revision made to the text of Blake is the re-spelling of dialect.  Dialect is used to represent the speech of primarily slaves, such as Daddy Joe, Mammy Judy, Ailcey, and Andy.  Poor whites and immigrants such as the ferryman, Dave and Adeline Starkweather, and the likely-German Isaac Slusher also receive non-standard-English dialect.  Dialect serves the important purpose in Blake of distinguishing the "intelligent" people from the unintelligent, and is therefore of particular interest in this collation.  It was also clearly of interest to Delany, who wrote to William Lloyd Garrett, "The language used may seem odd, but it is that made use of by the slave" (letter 19 Feb. 1859).  According to his letter, Delany intended the dialect to resemble that of the speaker, so it is interesting that so much of it was revised for the 1861 serialization.  Below are some examples of the changes made:</p>
