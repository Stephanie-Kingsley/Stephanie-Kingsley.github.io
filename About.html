	<div type="bio">
		<p>I grew up in Marietta, Georgia, with my parents and younger sister.  I completed my AB in English and Spanish at the University of Georgia in 2010 and moved to Charlotte, where I worked writing closed captioning for television.  In the fall of 2012 I entered the Graduate English Program at UVA, and I cannot imagine any place better suited to my interests, both textual and digital.  I have taken David Vander Meulen's courses in bibliography and textual editing, and I have delved into DH as an assistant to Alison Booth, an intern at Documents Compass, and a Praxis Fellow.  I am particularly interested in digital textual editing.</p>
		<p>In my spare time I play the violin, often with a community orchestra, but I enjoy improvisational playing, as well.  I also conduct genealogical research on my own family history when I feel the need for an intense bout of recreational research.  On a more casual basis, I have recently picked up dyeing pysanky, Ukrainian Easter eggs.  I live with my cat and two roommates in Charlottesville, VA.</p>
