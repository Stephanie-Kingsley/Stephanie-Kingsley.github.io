<h2>M.A. candidate in English, rising publishing and digital humanities professional</h2>
<img src="mewithtree.jpg">
<div id="content">
<p>I graduated in May from the Master's program in the <a href="http://www.engl.virginia.edu" target="_blank">University of Virginia English Department</a>.  I specialize in 19th-century American literature, textual studies, and digital humanities.  I am currently participating in this year's <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/" target="_blank">Praxis</a> Fellowship in the Scholar's Lab, as well as the <a href="http://www.rarebookschool.org/" target="_blank">Rare Book School</a> UVA Fellowship Program.  I am particularly interested in digital applications to textual editing and plan to work in publishing and digital archiving.</p>
<h3>More About Me</h3>
<p>I grew up in Marietta, Georgia, with my parents and younger sister.  I completed my AB in English and Spanish at the University of Georgia in 2010 and moved to Charlotte, where I worked writing closed captioning for television.  In the fall of 2012 I entered the Graduate English Program at UVA, and I cannot imagine any place better suited to my interests, both textual and digital.  I have taken David Vander Meulen's courses in bibliography and textual editing, and I have delved into DH as an assistant to Alison Booth, an intern at Documents Compass, and a Praxis Fellow.  I am particularly interested in digital textual editing.</p>
<p>In my spare time I play the violin, often with a community orchestra, but I enjoy improvisational playing, as well.  I also conduct genealogical research on my own family history when I feel the need for an intense bout of recreational research.  On a more casual basis, I have recently picked up dyeing pysanky, Ukrainian Easter eggs.  I live with my cat and two roommates in Charlottesville, VA.</p>
