<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I graduated in May with my Master's in English from the University of Virginia, where I specialized in American literature, book history and textual studies, and digital humanities.  I participated in last year's <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> in the <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a> and was also a <a href="http://www.rarebookschool.org/">Rare Book School</a> UVA Fellow.  I am particularly interested in digital applications to textual editing.  I am passionate about the preservation of history, literature, and culture and making resources for learning about them available to a wider audience.  As web and social media editor at the American Historical Association, I now have the opportunity to work in support of that mission.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I grew up in Marietta, Georgia, with my parents and younger sister.  I completed my AB in English and Spanish at the University of Georgia in 2010 and moved to Charlotte, where I worked writing closed captioning for television.  In the fall of 2012 I entered the Graduate English Program at UVa, and I cannot imagine any place better suited to my interests.  I have taken David Vander Meulen's courses in bibliography and textual editing, and I have learned about the digital humanities on a variety of <a href="Projects.html">digital projects</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time I play the violin, often in an orchestral setting, but I also enjoy improvisational playing; I am currently learning Baroque violin and bluegrass.  I enjoy genealogy when I feel the need for a bout of recreational research, and as an artistic outlet I have picked up dyeing <i>pysanky</i>, Ukrainian Easter eggs.  I now live with my two cats in Bethesda, MD.</p>
