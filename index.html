<h2>Publishing and digital humanities professional</h2>
<div id="summary">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I graduated in May with my M.A. in English from the University of Virginia, where I specialize in 19th-century American literature, textual studies, and digital humanities.  I participated in this year's <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/" target="_blank">Praxis Program</a> in the <a href="scholarslab.org">Scholar's Lab</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.rarebookschool.org/" target="_blank">Rare Book School</a> UVA Fellowship Program.  I am particularly interested in digital applications to textual editing.  I am passionate about preserving history, literature, and culture while also making resources for learning about them available to a wider audience.  I see digital technology as a way of doing this.  I am now seeking work at a publishing house, library, university, or cultural-heritage institution, either in an editorial capacity or as a project manager.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I grew up in Marietta, Georgia, with my parents and younger sister.  I completed my AB in English and Spanish at the University of Georgia in 2010 and moved to Charlotte, where I worked writing closed captioning for television.  In the fall of 2012 I entered the Graduate English Program at UVA, and I cannot imagine any place better suited to my interests, both textual and digital.  I have taken David Vander Meulen's courses in bibliography and textual editing, and I have delved into DH as an assistant to Alison Booth, an intern at Documents Compass, and a Praxis Fellow.</p>
<p>In my spare time I play the violin, often with a community orchestra, but I enjoy improvisational playing, as well.  I also conduct genealogical research on my family when I feel the need for an intense bout of recreational research.  On a more casual basis, I have recently picked up dyeing <i>pysanky</i>, Ukrainian Easter eggs.  I live with my cat and two roommates in Charlottesville, VA.</p>
