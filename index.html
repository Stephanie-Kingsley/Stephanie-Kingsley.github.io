<div id="bio">
<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I have a Master's in English from the University of Virginia, where I specialized in American literature, book history and textual studies, and digital humanities. I am passionate about the preservation of history, literature, and culture and making resources for learning about them available to a wider audience.</p>
<p>As web and social media editor at the American Historical Association from 2014 to 2018, I had the opportunity to work in support of that mission. I edited and developed content for the AHA's blog, website, and social media accounts. In support of the association's goals, I also collaborated with the marketing manager on outreach and web developers on projects to improve the website. My role involved frequent communication with AHA members.</p>
<p>Now as a Navy wife and stepmom of two, I offer remote consulting services for businesses, nonprofits, and individuals looking to improve their web presence. I am also seeking opportunities to work on digital editorial and database projects.</p>
<p>In my spare time I play the violin in a community orchestra; I have also dabbled in jazz, Baroque, and bluegrass violin music. I enjoy genealogy, gardening, and exploring local parks. I currently live with my husband and two cats on Whidbey Island, Washington.</p>
