	<h3>Digitization of Source Texts</h3>
<p>I produced my digital texts from photocopies of the XXX Press edition of the 1859 Volume I Anglo-African Magazine and digitized photocopies of the 1861-62 Anglo-African Weekly broadsides.  For the reprint of the 1859 magazine, I was able to produce my digital text using ABBYY FineReader optical character recognition software, inputting into Word as text files.  I prepared the 1861-62 text by transcribing it myself, as the resolution of the digitizations did not permit me the use of OCR.</p>

	<h3>Collation in Juxta</h3>
<p>After creating my text files, I split them into chapters and created by-chapter collations using Juxta, the collation software produced by NINES in partnership with the University of Virginia Scholars' Lab.  This stage involved 'cleaning' of my texts—correction of errors produced as a result of the digitization process.  These included OCR errors in the 59 text and transcription errors in the 61-62 text.  I caught and corrected these in the course of examining the Juxta visualizations by checking them against my original materials.</p>
<p>After correcting my texts—termed in Juxta "witnesses"—I then used Juxta's experimental "Edition Builder" feature to produce HTML files of the collations, using the 59 text as the base text, with variants in the 61-62 shown in the apparatus at the bottom of the page, produced automatically by Juxta.  Users can now explore the text chapter by chapter from the Blake Home page.</p>
